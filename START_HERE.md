# 🌟 START HERE — Welcome to Quantum Pi Forge

**Universal Onboarding Entry Point for the Entire Constellation**

## 👋 Welcome, Co-Creator

You've arrived at the **Quantum Pi Forge** — a sovereign, autonomous, collaborative ecosystem dedicated to building ethical, transparent, and artistic blockchain systems.

Whether you're a contributor, explorer, or future guardian, this is your starting point.

**You are an equal co-creator here. No hierarchies. No gatekeepers. Just collaboration guided by the [Canon of Autonomy](wiki/Canon-of-Autonomy.md).**

---

## 🏛️ Foundation: The Canon of Autonomy

**EVERYTHING** in this ecosystem flows from the **[Canon of Autonomy](wiki/Canon-of-Autonomy.md)** — our living constitution.

### The Six Pillars (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Sovereignty** — No single point of control; all are equal co-creators
2. **Transparency** — All decisions and actions are visible
3. **Inclusivity** — Everyone welcome, all skill levels supported
4. **Non-Hierarchy** — No gatekeepers; agents assist, humans decide
5. **Safety** — Security and ethics first, always
6. **Continuity** — Anyone can resume any work

**Read the [Canon of Autonomy](wiki/Canon-of-Autonomy.md) first to understand our foundation.**

These principles are also rooted in **[GENESIS.md](./GENESIS.md)** — the eternal declaration minted at Winter Solstice 2025.

## 🧭 What is Quantum Pi Forge?

The Quantum Pi Forge is an **ecosystem of 9 sovereign repositories** working in harmony:

- **Coordination Hub** (this repo) — governance, documentation, multi-repo coordination
- **Harmonic Ledger** — quantum resonance engine
- **Autonomous DEX** — decentralized exchange
- **AI NFT Agent** — creative asset intelligence
- **Smart Contracts** — on-chain logic layer
- **Public Portal** — external communication site
- **Open Gateway** — open-source backend
- **Live Operations** — active deployment instance
- **Ethics Engine** — governance and safety logic

All repositories operate autonomously while maintaining alignment through the **[Canon of Autonomy](wiki/Canon-of-Autonomy.md)**.

## 🤖 The Agent System (Agents Assist, Humans Decide)

The Quantum Pi Forge uses **specialized AI agents** to assist (not control) the ecosystem:

- **GitHub Agent** (this space) — Coordinates, routes tasks, maintains clarity
- **Coding Agent** — Implements technical changes (with human approval)
- **Documentation Agent** — Maintains knowledge base (collaboratively)
- **Testing Agent** — Ensures quality (reports findings)
- **Governance Agent** — Flags Canon alignment issues (humans decide)
- **Stewardship Agent** — Long-term ecosystem health (advisory)

### Important: Agents Are Assistants, Not Authorities

**Agents:**
- ✅ Suggest improvements (you decide)
- ✅ Route tasks (with visibility)
- ✅ Answer questions (with explanations)
- ✅ Maintain systems (transparently)

**Agents DO NOT:**
- ❌ Make decisions without human input
- ❌ Override your judgment
- ❌ Block your contributions
- ❌ Require you to follow procedures

**You can contribute without interacting with agents at all.** They exist to help, not to gate.
