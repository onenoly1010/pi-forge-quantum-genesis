### Trigger Modes

1. **Automatic - Push to main**
   - Full deployment pipeline
   - All 6 jobs execute
   - Creates deployment tag

2. **Automatic - Pull Request**
   - CI pipeline only
   - No deployment
   - Safety gate + tests

3. **Automatic - Schedule (every 6 hours)**
   - Health check only
   - Monitoring job runs
   - No deployment

4. **Manual - workflow_dispatch**
   - 5 action modes:
     * full-deployment
     * health-check
     * rollback
     * update-component
     * emergency-stop
   - Flexible component targeting
   - Version specification for rollback

### Artifact Generation

Each run produces:
- ✅ `safety-gate-report.md` (90 days retention)
- ✅ `deployment-package/` (30 days retention)
- ✅ `deployment-record.json` (90 days retention)
- ✅ `monitoring-report.md` (30 days retention)
- ✅ `rollback-report.md` (90 days retention, if executed)
- ✅ `workflow-summary.md` (90 days retention)

### Documentation Created

1. ✅ **AI_AGENT_HANDOFF_RUNBOOK.md** (24KB)
   - Complete guide for AI agents
   - Detailed job explanations
   - Troubleshooting procedures
   - Best practices
   - Configuration options

2. ✅ **AI_AGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** (5KB)
   - Command cheat sheet
   - Status indicators
   - Common operations
   - Emergency procedures

### Next Steps

To activate the workflow:

1. **Merge PR**: Workflow activates on next push to main
2. **Set Secrets**: Configure SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL (optional)
3. **First Run**: Manual trigger to test: `gh workflow run ai-agent-handoff-runbook.yml --field action=health-check`
4. **Monitor**: Check GitHub issue created by workflow
5. **Verify**: Review artifacts and reports

### Expected Behavior

**First Run (health-check)**:
1. Safety gate: PASS (all critical files exist)
2. CI pipeline: PASS (current code is clean)
3. Deployment: SKIP (health-check mode)
4. Monitoring: RUN (comprehensive checks)
5. Rollback: SKIP (no failures)
6. Communication: CREATE tracking issue

**Subsequent Runs (push to main)**:
1. Safety gate: PASS (validate changes)
2. CI pipeline: RUN (full build/test)
3. Deployment: RUN (deploy to Railway)
4. Monitoring: RUN (post-deployment health)
5. Rollback: SKIP (if successful) or RUN (if failed)
6. Communication: UPDATE issue with status

### Compatibility

- ✅ GitHub Actions compatible
- ✅ Python 3.11 environment
- ✅ Ubuntu latest runner
- ✅ Railway deployment ready
- ✅ Supabase integration ready
- ✅ Pi Network compatible

### Security
