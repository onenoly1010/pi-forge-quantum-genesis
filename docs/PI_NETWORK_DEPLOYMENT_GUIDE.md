## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Database Setup

1. **Apply Supabase Migration:**
```bash
# Navigate to Supabase SQL Editor
# Copy and execute: supabase_migrations/001_payments_schema.sql
```

2. **Verify Tables Created:**
```sql
-- Check if payments table exists
SELECT * FROM payments LIMIT 1;

-- Check views
SELECT * FROM payment_analytics LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM user_payment_summary LIMIT 1;
```

### Step 2: Environment Configuration

1. **Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. **Configure CRITICAL environment variables:**

```bash
# Supabase (REQUIRED)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-key
JWT_SECRET=generate-secure-random-string

# Pi Network (REQUIRED for mainnet)
PI_NETWORK_MODE=mainnet
PI_NETWORK_APP_ID=your-mainnet-app-id
PI_NETWORK_API_KEY=your-mainnet-api-key
PI_NETWORK_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.minepi.com
PI_SANDBOX_MODE=false

# Webhook Security (REQUIRED)
PI_NETWORK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret

# Optional - Only if sending Pi to users
PI_NETWORK_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your-wallet-private-key
```

### Step 3: Pi Developer Portal Configuration

1. **Configure Payment Callbacks:**
   - Go to Pi Developer Portal > Your App > Settings
   - Set **Payment Completion Callback URL**: `https://your-domain.com/api/payments/complete`
   - Set **Webhook URL**: `https://your-domain.com/api/pi-webhooks/payment`
   - Generate and save **Webhook Secret**

2. **App Permissions:**
   - Enable `payments` scope
   - Enable `username` scope (optional)
   - Enable `wallet_address` scope (optional)

### Step 4: Deploy to Railway

1. **Install Railway CLI:**
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

2. **Login and Link Project:**
```bash
railway login
railway link
```

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Set all variables from .env
railway variables set SUPABASE_URL=https://...
railway variables set SUPABASE_KEY=...
railway variables set PI_NETWORK_MODE=mainnet
railway variables set PI_NETWORK_APP_ID=...
railway variables set PI_NETWORK_API_KEY=...
railway variables set PI_NETWORK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...
```

4. **Deploy:**
```bash
railway up
```

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

1. **Check Health Endpoint:**
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "FastAPI Quantum Conduit",
  "supabase_connected": true,
  "timestamp": 1702345678.123
}
```

2. **Check Pi Network Status:**
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/pi-network/status
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "network": "mainnet",
  "sandbox_mode": false,
  "api_configured": true,
  "app_configured": true,
  "mainnet_ready": true,
  "timestamp": 1702345678.123
}
```

## 🔐 Security Checklist

### Before Going Live:

- [ ] **SSL/TLS enabled** (automatic on Railway/Vercel)
- [ ] **Environment variables secured** (never commit to git)
- [ ] **Webhook secret configured** for signature verification
- [ ] **Row Level Security enabled** in Supabase
- [ ] **Rate limiting configured** (built-in, 60 req/min per IP)
- [ ] **CORS configured** for your frontend domain only
- [ ] **Monitoring enabled** (logs, alerts, metrics)

### Production Best Practices:

```bash
# Enable production mode
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
ENVIRONMENT=production

# Use strong JWT secret
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Restrict CORS origins
CORS_ORIGINS=https://quantumpiforge.com,https://www.quantumpiforge.com
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Payment Flow

### 1. Test in Sandbox First:

```bash
# Use sandbox mode for testing
PI_NETWORK_MODE=testnet
PI_SANDBOX_MODE=true
PI_NETWORK_APP_ID=your-sandbox-app-id
PI_NETWORK_API_KEY=your-sandbox-api-key
```

### 2. Test Payment Endpoints:

```bash
# Approve payment
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/payments/approve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
  -d '{
    "payment_id": "test_payment_123",
    "amount": 0.15,
    "user_id": "user_uuid",
    "metadata": {"type": "mining_boost"}
  }'

# Complete payment
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/payments/complete \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "payment_id": "test_payment_123",
    "txid": "blockchain_tx_hash"
  }'
```

### 3. Monitor Logs:

```bash
# Railway logs
railway logs

# Check for:
# ✅ "Payment approved: payment_id"
# ✅ "Payment completed: payment_id"
# 📨 "Webhook received: completed for payment payment_id"
```

## 📊 Database Queries for Monitoring

### Check Payment Status:
```sql
SELECT 
    payment_id, 
    status, 
    amount, 
    resonance_state,
    created_at,
    completed_at
FROM payments 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### Payment Analytics:
```sql
SELECT 
    payment_date,
    status,
    payment_count,
    total_amount,
    avg_amount
FROM payment_analytics
WHERE payment_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY payment_date DESC;
```

### User Statistics:
```sql
SELECT 
    u.email,
    ups.total_payments,
    ups.completed_payments,
    ups.total_pi_spent
FROM user_payment_summary ups
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = ups.user_id
ORDER BY total_pi_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "PI_NETWORK_API_KEY not set"
**Solution:** 
```bash
railway variables set PI_NETWORK_API_KEY=your-actual-key
railway restart
```

### Issue: "Invalid webhook signature"
**Solution:**
1. Verify webhook secret matches Pi Developer Portal
2. Check `PI_NETWORK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable
3. Ensure webhook URL uses HTTPS

### Issue: "Payment approval failed"
**Solution:**
1. Check Pi Network API status
2. Verify payment_id is valid
3. Check payment amount matches
4. Review logs: `railway logs | grep "Payment approval"`

### Issue: "Database error on payment insert"
**Solution:**
1. Verify Supabase migration ran successfully
2. Check RLS policies allow inserts
3. Ensure user is authenticated

## 🔄 Switching from Testnet to Mainnet

### When Ready for Production:

1. **Update Environment Variables:**
```bash
railway variables set PI_NETWORK_MODE=mainnet
railway variables set PI_SANDBOX_MODE=false
railway variables set PI_NETWORK_APP_ID=mainnet-app-id
railway variables set PI_NETWORK_API_KEY=mainnet-api-key
```

2. **Update Pi Developer Portal:**
   - Switch app to mainnet mode
   - Update webhook URLs to production domain
   - Regenerate webhook secret

3. **Redeploy:**
```bash
railway up
```

4. **Verify:**
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/pi-network/status
# Should show: "network": "mainnet"
```

---

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track:

1. **Payment Success Rate:** `completed_payments / total_payments`
2. **Average Payment Amount:** From `payment_analytics`
3. **Payment Processing Time:** Check `processing_time_ns` in responses
4. **Webhook Delivery:** Monitor webhook endpoint logs

### Set Up Alerts:

```bash
# Monitor payment failures
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments 
WHERE status = 'failed' 
AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```
