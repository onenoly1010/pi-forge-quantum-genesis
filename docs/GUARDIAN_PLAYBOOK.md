## Decision-Making Framework

### Confidence-Based System

The autonomous decision matrix uses confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0) to determine if guardian approval is required:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Confidence Score      │ Action                  │
├──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ 0.9 - 1.0            │ Auto-approve (log only)  │
│ 0.8 - 0.9            │ Auto-approve (notify)    │
│ 0.6 - 0.8            │ Guardian review required │
│ 0.4 - 0.6            │ Detailed analysis needed │
│ 0.0 - 0.4            │ Reject or escalate       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Decision Criteria

When reviewing decisions, consider:

1. **Safety**: Does this pose any security or stability risks?
2. **Impact**: What's the blast radius if something goes wrong?
3. **Reversibility**: Can this be easily rolled back?
4. **Timing**: Is this the right time for this change?
5. **Context**: What else is happening in the system?
6. **History**: Have similar decisions succeeded/failed?

### Approval Guidelines

**Quick Approve** (< 5 minutes):
- Confidence >= 0.7
- Low/medium impact
- Easily reversible
- Routine operation type
- Good historical performance

**Standard Review** (< 1 hour):
- Confidence 0.5-0.7
- Medium/high impact
- Some complexity
- Non-routine operation
- Mixed historical performance

**Deep Analysis** (< 4 hours):
- Confidence < 0.5
- High/critical impact
- Complex operation
- Novel scenario
- Unknown risks

**Escalate** (consult team):
- Confidence < 0.4
- Unclear requirements
- Policy implications
- Financial impact > threshold
- Security concerns

## Daily Operations

### Morning Routine (5-10 minutes)

#### 1. Check Guardian Dashboard

```bash
# Local development
curl http://localhost:8000/api/guardian/dashboard | jq .

# Production
curl https://[deployment-url]/api/guardian/dashboard | jq .
```

**Review**:
- System status (should be "healthy")
- Pending decisions count
- Recent autonomous actions
- Safety metrics (all should be > 0.7)
- Active alerts

#### 2. Review Health Report

- Navigate to [Issue #76](https://github.com/onenoly1010/pi-forge-quantum-genesis/issues/76)
- Check latest automated health report (runs every 6 hours)
- Verify all components green
- Note any warnings or degraded services

#### 3. Check Pending Decisions

```bash
# Get decisions requiring approval
curl https://[url]/api/autonomous/decision-history?requires_guardian=true&status=pending | jq .
```

**For each pending decision**:
- Read decision details
- Check confidence score
- Review reasoning
- Assess risk
- Approve or schedule for detailed review

#### 4. Review Overnight Activity

```bash
# Get last 12 hours of decisions
curl https://[url]/api/autonomous/decision-history?limit=50&hours=12 | jq .
```

**Look for**:
- Unusual patterns
- High rejection rates
- Confidence score trends
- Any failures or errors

### Throughout the Day

#### Active Monitoring

- **Check email/alerts** every 1-2 hours
- **Review dashboard** every 4 hours
- **Respond to critical alerts** within 1 hour
- **Respond to high-priority** within 4 hours

#### Decision Processing

**Batch processing** (every 2-4 hours):
1. Gather pending decisions
2. Group by type and priority
3. Review and decide
4. Document reasoning
5. Monitor execution

#### Collaboration

- **AI Assistant**: Delegate routine queries to @app/copilot-swe-agent
- **Development Team**: Coordinate on complex issues
- **Community**: Monitor discussions and issues

### End of Day (5 minutes)

#### 1. Final Dashboard Check

```bash
curl https://[url]/api/guardian/dashboard | jq .
```

Ensure no pending critical items.

#### 2. Review Day's Metrics

```bash
curl https://[url]/api/autonomous/metrics | jq .
```

**Check**:
- Total decisions made
- Approval rate (should be 70-90%)
- Average confidence (should be > 0.75)
- Guardian escalation rate (should be 10-30%)

#### 3. Document Notable Events

Update Guardian Log with:
- Significant decisions
- Issues encountered
- Lessons learned
- Action items for tomorrow

  -H "Authorization: Bearer <guardian-token>" \
  -d '{"action": "restart_services", "approved": true}'
```

**Option B: Rollback**
```bash
# Trigger rollback via workflow or manual process
# See docs/ROLLBACK_VALIDATION.md for procedures

# Quick rollback to last known good state
gh workflow run rollback.yml --ref main

# Or manual git-based rollback (coordinate with team)
git revert <bad-commit-hash>
```

**Option C: Manual Fix**
```bash
# Access production environment
# Apply hotfix

# 3. Test critical paths
# - User login
# - Payment processing
# - Smart contract interactions

# 4. Monitor for 15 minutes
# Watch for recurring issues
```

**STEP 5: Resume Operations (< 5 minutes)**

```bash
# Re-enable autonomous operations
curl -X POST https://[url]/api/guardian/resume \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <guardian-token>" \
  -d '{"confirmed": true, "guardian_id": "your-id"}'
```

**STEP 6: Post-Incident (< 2 hours)**

1. **Document incident**
   - Timeline of events
   - Root cause analysis
   - Actions taken
   - Resolution details

- [ ] Communication plan ready?

**Fast-track approval** (emergency):
- Critical service failure
- Security vulnerability
- Data integrity risk

### 4. Healing Decisions

**Confidence threshold**: 0.75

**Review checklist**:
- [ ] Issue correctly diagnosed?
- [ ] Healing action appropriate?
- [ ] No data loss risk?
- [ ] Can verify success?

**Auto-approve**:
- Service restart
- Cache clearing
- Resource cleanup
- Connection pool reset

**Require approval**:
- Database operations
- File system changes
- Configuration modifications

### 5. Monitoring Decisions

**Confidence threshold**: 0.85

**Review checklist**:
- [ ] Alert threshold appropriate?

### 6. Guardian Override Decisions

**Confidence threshold**: N/A (manual review always)

**Review checklist**:
