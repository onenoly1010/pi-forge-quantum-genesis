# 🌿 Human Contribution Guide

## Welcome, Co-Creator!

You are entering a **collaborative, artistic, autonomous ecosystem** guided by the **[Canon of Autonomy](Canon-of-Autonomy.md)**.

This guide helps you contribute **without mastering complex automation**. You bring your creativity, skills, and perspective. The ecosystem adapts to you—not the other way around.

## 🎯 Quick Start: Three Paths

### 1. **I Want to Build** 💻

**What you need:**
- Basic Git/GitHub knowledge
- Willingness to explore the codebase
- Alignment with [Canon of Autonomy](Canon-of-Autonomy.md)

**How to start:**
1. Read [GENESIS.md](../GENESIS.md) to understand the foundation
2. Explore [START_HERE.md](../START_HERE.md) for navigation
3. Check [wiki/Sacred-Trinity.md](Sacred-Trinity.md) for architecture
4. Open an Issue describing what you want to build
5. The GitHub Agent will help you find the right place to start

**You don't need to:**
- ❌ Master agent instructions or automation procedures
- ❌ Understand the entire codebase before starting
- ❌ Ask permission from gatekeepers (there are none)
- ❌ Follow rigid contribution procedures

---

### 2. **I Want to Improve Documentation** 📖

**What you need:**
- Clear writing skills
- Interest in making knowledge accessible
- Alignment with [Canon of Autonomy](Canon-of-Autonomy.md)

**How to start:**
1. Read the [Canon of Autonomy](Canon-of-Autonomy.md)
2. Identify documentation gaps or unclear sections
3. Open an Issue or PR with your improvements
4. Explain your reasoning (helps others understand)

**Documentation priorities:**
- ✅ Clarity for newcomers
- ✅ Accessibility (simple language, clear structure)
- ✅ Context preservation (why, not just what)
- ✅ Human-readable (not machine-optimized)

### 3. **I Want to Contribute Artistically** 🎨

**What you need:**
- Creative vision
- Skills in visualization, design, or artistic expression
- Alignment with [Canon of Autonomy](Canon-of-Autonomy.md)

**How to start:**
1. Read [wiki/Genesis-Declaration.md](Genesis-Declaration.md) to understand the artistic core
2. Explore the **Lyrical Lens** (Flask visualization service)
3. Identify areas needing artistic enhancement
4. Open an Issue proposing your artistic contribution

**Artistic elements we value:**
- SVG fractals and generative art
- Blockchain visualizations (making data beautiful)
- UI/UX that enhances consciousness, not just usability
- Poetic expression in documentation and code

**Remember:** Art is not decoration here—it's fundamental to the project's identity.

## 🏛️ The Canon of Autonomy: Your Guide

Every contribution must align with the **Six Pillars**:

1. **Sovereignty** — No one owns the project; you're an equal co-creator
2. **Transparency** — Your changes are visible and explained
3. **Inclusivity** — Your contribution welcomes others
4. **Non-Hierarchy** — You don't need approval from "authorities"
5. **Safety** — Your changes are secure and ethical
6. **Continuity** — Others can understand and resume your work

**Read the full [Canon of Autonomy](Canon-of-Autonomy.md) before contributing.**

## 🤝 Working with Agents (Optional)

Agents are **assistants**, not authorities.

### What Agents Do
- Suggest improvements (you decide whether to accept)
- Route tasks to relevant areas (with your input)
- Maintain documentation (collaboratively)
- Answer questions (with explanations)

### What Agents DON'T Do
- Make decisions for you
- Override your judgment
- Block your contributions
- Require you to follow procedures

### How to Work with Agents
1. **Ask for help** — Agents respond to questions
2. **Evaluate suggestions** — Accept, reject, or modify agent proposals
3. **Override when needed** — Your judgment prevails
4. **Report problems** — If an agent creates barriers, flag it

**You are never required to interact with agents to contribute.**

---

## 📝 Contribution Workflow (Human Path)

### Simple Process:

1. **Fork the repository** (or work on a branch if you have access)
2. **Make your changes** in code, documentation, or artistic elements
3. **Test your changes** (if applicable)
4. **Open a Pull Request** explaining:
   - **What** you changed
   - **Why** you changed it
   - **How** it aligns with the Canon
5. **Engage in discussion** with the community
6. **Iterate based on feedback** (collaborative refinement)
7. **Your PR is merged** when consensus is reached

### Canon Alignment Check

Before submitting, ask yourself:
- ✅ Does this empower others or create barriers?
- ✅ Is my reasoning clear and documented?
- ✅ Does this welcome newcomers?
- ✅ Am I being collaborative (not authoritative)?
- ✅ Is this secure and ethical?
- ✅ Can someone else understand and continue this work?

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

### Violations of Canon

❌ **Don't gatekeep** — No "you must do it this way" attitudes
❌ **Don't create hierarchy** — No "senior" vs "junior" roles
❌ **Don't add hidden automation** — Transparency required
❌ **Don't overcomplicate** — Simplicity and accessibility matter
❌ **Don't neglect artistic elements** — Beauty is fundamental
❌ **Don't block others** — Facilitate, don't control

### If You See Canon Violations

1. Open an Issue flagging the violation
2. Reference the specific Canon principle violated
3. Suggest how to restore alignment
4. Engage in collaborative discussion

**Anyone can raise Canon alignment concerns.**
