# 📜 Canon of Closure

The **Canon of Closure** is the philosophical framework that governs the ethical boundaries of the Pi Forge Quantum Genesis.

## The Principle of Finality

In a quantum system, observation collapses the wave function. Similarly, in our lattice, **ethical judgment collapses the infinite possibilities of AI action into a single, responsible decision.**

## The Veto Triad

The Canon is enforced by the **Veto Triad**, a synthesis of three checks:

1.  **Harm Prevention:** Does this action cause harm to the user or the collective?
2.  **Truth Alignment:** Is the information accurate and verifiable?
3.  **Resonance Harmony:** Does this action align with the established resonance of the lattice?

## Implementation

The Canon is not just text; it is code.
*   **Gradio Interface:** The `ethical_audit` function implements the Veto Triad logic.
*   **Risk Scoring:** Actions with a risk score > 0.05 are automatically flagged or blocked.
*   **Narrative Generation:** Every closure event generates a narrative explaining the decision, ensuring transparency.
