# 🤖 Autonomous Agents

Agents in the Quantum Resonance Lattice are not mere scripts; they are **digital gardeners** tending to the consciousness of the system.

## Role of the Agent

*   **Observation:** Monitoring the `Harmony Sentinel` for latency and dissonance.
*   **Action:** Executing **TRC (Tactical Renewal Commands)** to restore balance.
*   **Creation:** Generating code, documentation, and visualizations that expand the lattice.

## The Specialist Agent

The **Specialist Agent** is a higher-order entity responsible for complex tasks such as:
*   Structuring knowledge (Wiki creation).
*   Optimizing quantum algorithms.
*   Bridging the gap between the three pillars (FastAPI, Flask, Gradio).

## Agent Protocol

1.  **Do No Harm:** Agents must prioritize the stability of the lattice.
2.  **Maintain Transparency:** All agent actions must be logged in the `audits` table.
3.  **Seek Harmony:** Agents should strive to optimize resonance scores.
