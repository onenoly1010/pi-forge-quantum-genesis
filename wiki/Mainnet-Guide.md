# 🌐 Mainnet Guide

Moving from Testnet to Mainnet.

## Checklist

1.  **SDK Switch:** Update `pi-sdk.js` configuration to use Mainnet.
2.  **API Key:** Replace Testnet API Key with Mainnet API Key in `.env`.
3.  **Wallet:** Ensure the App Wallet is funded (for any potential refunds/flows) and secure.
4.  **Compliance:** Verify adherence to Pi Network Developer Terms.

## Risks
*   **Real Value:** Mainnet Pi has real value. Ensure [[Identity Lock]] and security protocols are tight.
*   **Traffic:** Expect higher load. Scale Railway replicas if needed.
