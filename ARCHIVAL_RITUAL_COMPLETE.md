## 📋 File Diffs Summary

### README.md Changes
Added a new section immediately after the introduction:
```markdown
# 🏛️ Foundation: The OINIO Seal

All work in this ecosystem flows from the **[GENESIS.md](./GENESIS.md)** — 
the Eternal Archive that establishes our foundational commitments and principles.

Minted on Winter Solstice 2025, the OINIO Seal Declaration defines:
- Our core values (Sovereignty, Transparency, Inclusivity, Non-hierarchy, Safety)
- The constellation of repositories
- Verification and integrity protocols
- The eternal nature of our commitments
```

### ECOSYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md (New File)
Created comprehensive ecosystem documentation including:
- Foundation section prominently featuring GENESIS.md
- Full constellation mapping with repository roles
- Core commitments from the Genesis declaration
- Governance model and agent system
- Verification and integrity protocols
- Technology stack overview
- Contributing guidelines aligned with GENESIS principles

### docs/ARCHITECTURE.md Changes
Added foundation reference at the beginning:
```markdown
## Foundation

This architecture is built upon the principles established in **[GENESIS.md](../GENESIS.md)** — 
the Eternal Archive containing the OINIO Seal Declaration minted on Winter Solstice 2025.

For ecosystem-level overview, see **[ECOSYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md](../ECOSYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md)**.
```

## 🛡️ Verification Schedule Recommendation

As specified in GENESIS.md, the following verification routine is recommended:

### Quarterly Review (Every 3 Months)
**Purpose**: Ensure GENESIS.md integrity  
**Schedule**: March 21, June 21, September 21, December 21 (Solstices & Equinoxes)  
**Process**:
1. Verify GENESIS.md file hash matches canonical version
2. Check for any unauthorized modifications
3. Confirm all ecosystem documentation properly references GENESIS.md
4. Review alignment of repositories with Genesis principles
5. Document verification in Canon of Closure

**Automated Verification Command**:
```bash
# Generate hash of GENESIS.md
sha256sum GENESIS.md

# Compare with canonical hash (to be established)
# Expected: [hash to be recorded after first verification]
```

### Annual Seal Renewal (Every Winter Solstice)
**Purpose**: Reaffirm or update foundational commitments  
**Schedule**: December 21 (Winter Solstice)  
**Process**:
1. Conduct full quarterly review
2. Gather steward consensus on any proposed updates
3. Reaffirm existing commitments or formally update with consensus
4. Update GENESIS.md metadata if renewed
5. Document renewal ceremony in Canon of Closure

### Consensus Requirement
**Policy**: Any modification to GENESIS.md requires explicit steward consensus  
**Lead Guardian**: @onenoly1010  
**Process**:
1. Proposal must be submitted via GitHub issue
2. Full discussion and consideration period (minimum 7 days)
3. Explicit approval from Lead Guardian required
4. Changes must be committed with special ceremony
5. All modifications documented in GENESIS.md metadata section

---

## 🔒 Monitoring & Protection

### GitHub Protection
- GENESIS.md should be monitored for any edits or removal attempts
- Branch protection rules should prevent direct modification
- All changes must go through pull request with required review
- If GENESIS.md is modified without consensus, issue #159 should be reopened

### Canonical Hash Registry
Establish a canonical hash of GENESIS.md to enable verification:
```bash
# Current GENESIS.md hash (to be verified)
sha256sum GENESIS.md > GENESIS.md.sha256
```

This hash should be:
1. Stored in multiple locations (repo, documentation, external archive)
2. Used for quarterly verification
3. Updated only with proper consensus and ceremony
