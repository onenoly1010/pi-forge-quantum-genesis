This Space exists to:
- onboard contributors  
- coordinate multi‑repo work  
- maintain Canon alignment  
- support the GitHub Agent  
- document ecosystem evolution  
- surface improvements and gaps  
- unify the constellation

# 🏛️ Foundation: The OINIO Seal

All work in this ecosystem flows from the **[GENESIS.md](./GENESIS.md)** — the Eternal Archive that establishes our foundational commitments and principles.

Minted on Winter Solstice 2025, the OINIO Seal Declaration defines:
- Our core values (Sovereignty, Transparency, Inclusivity, Non-hierarchy, Safety)
- The constellation of repositories
- Verification and integrity protocols
- The eternal nature of our commitments

**Read the [GENESIS Declaration](./GENESIS.md) to understand the foundation upon which everything is built.**

# 🧭 Purpose of This Space

This Space is not a code repository — it is a **governance and coordination environment**.

It provides:
- a clear overview of all 9+ repositories  
- onboarding guidance for new contributors  
- a place for the GitHub Agent to operate  
- a home for ecosystem‑wide documentation  
- a staging ground for improvements  
- a map of the constellation  

Everything here is designed to support sovereignty, clarity, and continuity.

# 🤖 The GitHub Agent

The GitHub Agent in this Space:
- routes tasks  
- maintains clarity  
- supports contributors  
- identifies improvements  
- ensures Canon alignment  
- coordinates across repos  
- keeps the constellation coherent  

The Agent does **not** perform specialist work — it coordinates the specialists.

# 🧩 The Constellation

The Space tracks and coordinates the following repositories:
- **Genesis** — backend foundation  
- **Resonance Engine** — harmonic ledger  
- **DEX** — autonomous liquidity  
- **NFT System** — identity & creative assets  
- **Soul System** — ethics & governance logic  
- **OPEN** — open‑source backend  
- **Ignited** — active instance  
- **Contracts** — smart contract layer  
- **Site** — public‑facing portal  

Each repo is sovereign, but all are aligned through this Space.

## Frontend Architecture

Pi Forge Quantum Genesis uses a **distributed frontend architecture**:

- **Static Landing Pages:** `index.html`, `ceremonial_interface.html`, etc. (root directory)
- **Serverless API Functions:** `api/` directory (deployed to Vercel)
- **Backend Services:** `server/` directory (deployed to Render)
- **Build Process:** `scripts/build.js` packages for Vercel deployment

**Note:** There is no standalone `frontend/` directory. Frontend code is distributed across static HTML and serverless functions.
