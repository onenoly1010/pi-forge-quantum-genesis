# 🌐 Quantum Pi Forge — Coordination Space  
### A Sovereign Hub for the Autonomous Multi‑Agent Constellation

Welcome to the **Quantum Pi Forge Space** — the central coordination hub for the entire constellation of repositories, services, and agents that make up the Quantum Pi Forge ecosystem.

This Space exists to:
- onboard contributors  
- coordinate multi‑repo work  
- maintain Canon alignment  
- support the GitHub Agent  
- document ecosystem evolution  
- surface improvements and gaps  
- unify the constellation  

It is the living center of the ecosystem.

# 🧭 Purpose of This Space

This Space is not a code repository — it is a **governance and coordination environment**.

It provides:
- a clear overview of all 9+ repositories  
- onboarding guidance for new contributors  
- a place for the GitHub Agent to operate  
- a home for ecosystem‑wide documentation  
- a staging ground for improvements  
- a map of the constellation  

Everything here is designed to support sovereignty, clarity, and continuity.

# 🤖 The GitHub Agent

The GitHub Agent in this Space:
- routes tasks  
- maintains clarity  
- supports contributors  
- identifies improvements  
- ensures Canon alignment  
- coordinates across repos  
- keeps the constellation coherent  

The Agent does **not** perform specialist work — it coordinates the specialists.

# 🧩 The Constellation

The Space tracks and coordinates the following repositories:
- **Genesis** — backend foundation  
- **Resonance Engine** — harmonic ledger  
- **DEX** — autonomous liquidity  
- **NFT System** — identity & creative assets  
- **Soul System** — ethics & governance logic  
- **OPEN** — open‑source backend  
- **Ignited** — active instance  
- **Contracts** — smart contract layer  
- **Site** — public‑facing portal  

Each repo is sovereign, but all are aligned through this Space.
