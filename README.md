Welcome to the **Quantum Pi Forge Space** — the central coordination hub for the entire constellation of repositories, services, and agents that make up the Quantum Pi Forge ecosystem.

This Space exists to:
- onboard contributors  
- coordinate multi‑repo work  
- maintain Canon alignment  
- support the GitHub Agent  
- document ecosystem evolution  
- surface improvements and gaps  
- unify the constellation  

It is the living center of the ecosystem.

# 🏛️ Foundation: The OINIO Seal

All work in this ecosystem flows from the **[GENESIS.md](./GENESIS.md)** — the Eternal Archive that establishes our foundational commitments and principles.

Minted on Winter Solstice 2025, the OINIO Seal Declaration defines:
- Our core values (Sovereignty, Transparency, Inclusivity, Non-hierarchy, Safety)
- The constellation of repositories
- Verification and integrity protocols
- The eternal nature of our commitments

**Read the [GENESIS Declaration](./GENESIS.md) to understand the foundation upon which everything is built.**

# 🧭 Purpose of This Space

This Space is not a code repository — it is a **governance and coordination environment**.

It provides:
- a clear overview of all 9+ repositories  
- onboarding guidance for new contributors  
- a place for the GitHub Agent to operate  
- a home for ecosystem‑wide documentation  
- a staging ground for improvements  
- a map of the constellation  

Everything here is designed to support sovereignty, clarity, and continuity.

---

# 🤖 The GitHub Agent

The GitHub Agent in this Space:
- routes tasks  
- maintains clarity  
- supports contributors  
- identifies improvements  
- ensures Canon alignment  
- coordinates across repos  
- keeps the constellation coherent  

The Agent does **not** perform specialist work — it coordinates the specialists.

---

# 🧩 The Constellation

The Space tracks and coordinates the following repositories:
- **Genesis** — backend foundation  
- **Resonance Engine** — harmonic ledger  
- **DEX** — autonomous liquidity  
- **NFT System** — identity & creative assets  
- **Soul System** — ethics & governance logic  
- **OPEN** — open‑source backend  
- **Ignited** — active instance  
- **Contracts** — smart contract layer  
- **Site** — public‑facing portal  

Each repo is sovereign, but all are aligned through this Space.

# 🚀 Deployment & Infrastructure

## About This Repository

**This is a coordination and documentation hub, NOT a deployable frontend application.**

This repository serves as:
- **Governance center** for the Quantum Pi Forge constellation
- **Documentation hub** for ecosystem-wide information
- **Coordination space** for multi-repo workflows
- **GitHub Agent home base** for task routing

### What This Repo Does NOT Provide:
- ❌ Deployable frontend application
- ❌ Production web service
- ❌ User-facing interface

### What IS Deployed:

#### 1. Public-Facing Site (GitHub Pages)
- **URL**: https://onenoly1010.github.io/quantum-pi-forge-site/
- **Repository**: `quantum-pi-forge-site`
- **Purpose**: External communication and manifesto

#### 2. Backend API (Railway)
- **URL**: https://pi-forge-quantum-genesis.railway.app
- **Service**: FastAPI Quantum Conduit
- **Health Check**: `/health`

#### 3. Resonance Engine (Vercel)
- **URL**: https://quantum-resonance-clean.vercel.app
- **Repository**: `quantum-resonance-clean`
- **Purpose**: Harmonic ledger backend

### Vercel Configuration Note

This repository includes a `vercel.json` file that:
- Builds static documentation pages from the coordination hub
- Serves minimal HTML interfaces for demonstration purposes
- Routes API calls to the Railway backend
- **Is NOT intended as a production deployment**

**If you connected this repo to Vercel by mistake**, you can safely disconnect it:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings
2. Select this project (`pi-forge-quantum-genesis`)
3. Navigate to "General" settings
4. Scroll to "Delete Project" and remove the deployment

The Vercel configuration exists primarily for:
- Build verification in CI/CD
- Optional static documentation hosting
- Development preview environments

For production deployments, refer to the appropriate service repositories listed above.

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment documentation.

## Frontend Architecture

Pi Forge Quantum Genesis uses a **distributed frontend architecture**:

- **Static Landing Pages:** `index.html`, `ceremonial_interface.html`, etc. (root directory)
- **Serverless API Functions:** `api/` directory (deployed to Vercel)
- **Backend Services:** `server/` directory (deployed to Railway)
- **Build Process:** `scripts/build.js` packages for Vercel deployment

**Note:** There is no standalone `frontend/` directory. Frontend code is distributed across static HTML and serverless functions.
